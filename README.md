- 👋 Hi, I’m @Charanadari from Visakhapatnam.

- 👀 I’m passionate about mechanical works and exploring new technologies in the field.

- 🌱 I’m currently in my last year of mechanical engineering at VIGNAN, Visakhapatnam. My coursework and projects have provided me with a solid foundation in mechanical design, thermodynamics, and materials science.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative ideas, particularly in areas such as sustainable energy solutions, advanced manufacturing techniques, and automation.

- 📫 You can reach me via email at charanadari2002@gmail.com. I’m always open to discussing new projects or potential collaborations.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love taking apart gadgets to understand how they work and finding ways to improve their efficiency. When I'm not working on mechanical projects, you might find me hiking or experimenting with DIY projects at home.
